`npm install -g shh-ssh`

be delighted when you keep typing `shh` instead of `ssh`

what will you see? your life will never be the same. why settle for messages telling you shh doesn't exist.

maybe you did mean to type ssh, but maybe... just maybe you wanted to explore the unknown.

this package does all this and more.

*shh*
